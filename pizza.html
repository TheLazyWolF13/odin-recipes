      <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a quick and easy recipe for making a great homemade pizza. It uses only 6 ingredients for the base, and is fun to customise and play around with.</p>
      <h4>The ingredients are;</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>All-purpose flour.</li>
          <li>Sugar. Honey works very well in place of sugar.</li>
          <li>Olive oil. Any neutral tasting oil works perfectly in this recipe, I suggest olive oil, avocado oil or canola oil.</li>
          <li>Water (warmed to 105 degrees F (600W for around 50 secs)).</li>
          <li>Salt - sea salt best if possible.</li>
          <li>Yeast - an integral part of bread-making.</li>
          <li>Pizza Sauce - see here for my quick, easy, and delicious tomato pizza sauce recipe.</li>
          <li>Toppings: I'm a veggie at heart and my personal favorite is black olives, mushroom, and jalapeno.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Steps;</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 260 degrees celcius. If pizza stone, preheat that too for 10 mins before cooking.</li>
          <li>Combine warm water, yeast and sugar in a large mixing bowl and stir to combine.</li>
          <li>Let mixture sit for 5 minutes, or until it becomes frothy and bubbles form.</li>
          <li>Gently stir in olive oil.</li>
          <li>Add 240-250 grams of flour and salt and mix with a spatula until a ball begins to form (dough will still be slightly sticky). Add more flour as needed to form a dough ball.</li>
          <li>Transfer to a floured surface and knead into a smooth dough, adding up to 60-65 grams extra flour if needed.</li>
          <li>Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel and let it rise for 10 minutes or up to 1 hour.</li>
          <li>Roll the dough into your desired shape and put it on a piece of parchment paper.</li>
          <li>Add pizza sauce, cheese and toppings of choice.</li>
          <li>Bake in the oven for 11-14 minutes at 260 degrees celcius.</li>
        </ol>
