      <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is the recipe for a homemade baked feta and tomato pasta. It's tastiest with tagliatelle pasta, though macaroni and penne is also apparently good.</p>
      <h4>The ingredients are;</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>550-680g Cherry Tomatoes</li>
          <li>1 Shallot, quartered - or red onion if don't have</li>
          <li>118.4 ml Olive Oil</li>
          <li>~220g Feta (drain well and handle with care so as not to break apart)</li>
          <li>3 Thyme Sprigs</li>
          <li>3 Garlic Cloves, smashed</li>
          <li>Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes</li>
          <li>1 Lemon (for zest)</li>
          <li>~340g Pasta</li>
          <li>Basil leaves (for serving)</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>The Steps;</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven at 200 degrees celcius.</li>
          <li>In a large ovenproof skillet or medium baking dish, combine shallot, garlic, tomatoes, and all but 1 Tbsp. oil; season with salt and red pepper flakes and toss to combine.</li>
          <li>Place feta into center of tomato mixture; drizzle with reserved 1 Tbsp. oil. Scatter thyme sprigs over tomatoes.</li>
          <li>Bake sauce until tomatoes are bursting and feta is golden on top, 40 to 45 minutes - be careful not to burn everything.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta, stirring occasionally, until al dente according to package directions. Reserve 118.4 ml pasta water before draining.</li>
          <li>To serve, add cooked pasta, reserved pasta water, and lemon zest (if using) and stir until combined. Top with basil.</li>
        </ol>
